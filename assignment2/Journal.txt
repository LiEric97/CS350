Explain the reason for any differences reported by the time reported by your 
module and the time reported by user-level gettimeofday() library routine.
    - The most obvious difference is the granuality of the three timing mechanisms. 
The user-level gettimeofday() and getnstimeofday() has better a better granuality 
than current_kernel_time(). 


Run the user-level program for various values of N. Explain the reasons for any differences that you observe between the three timing mechanisms.
    - gettimeofday and getnstimeofday stays in sync with the actual time, while 
current_kernel_time does not.
    - A possible reason for the time differences is how current_kernel_time allows 
for the access of xtime atomically.

Now, change the module so that init_module() returns -1, recompile, and retest. 
What happens? Why?

    - We get the message: insmod: ERROR: could not insert module mytime_module.ko: 
Operation not permitted
    - This is because init_module returns 0 on success, and -1 on error.
